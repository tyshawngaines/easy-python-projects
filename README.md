# 10-Python-Projects
Beginner to intermediate projects for Python

Hello and welcome.
If you are here then either you like to read or you like to learn.
Either way here are some projects I decided to whip up for the lost soul's.
What you see are my skills, so this is considered best practice until I learn better methods.
Feel free to reach out to if you see a faster way of doing these projects.
